IV. Using the code:
-------------------
Some parts of the code are specific to AUC, other parts need 
customization to make it work. 
The main part that is specific to AUC is the
LDAP authentication in:
    *. aucldapauth.py
    *. migrationwizard/backends/ldapbackend.py

The main module to customize is:
    *. migrationwizard/ocsettings.py
