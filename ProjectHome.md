Google and [The American University in Cairo (AUC)](http://www.aucegypt.edu) formed a partnership to enhance the services provided by AUC to their students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Google provided AUC with access to the Google Apps platform. [OpenCraft](http://open-craft.com) was brought forward as the technical partner to implement this application which was built to ease the email and contacts migration for each of the 13,000 users that comprise the AUC online community. [OpenCraft](http://open-craft.com) developed a self-service migration portal which takes the user step-by-step at his own pace through the process. You can have a look at the [case study](http://open-craft.com/portfolio/auc-google-apps-migration) and find more information about the system [here](http://open-craft.com/solutions/services/google-apps-self-service-migration-wizard).
