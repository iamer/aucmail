<p class="sub-title" style="color:#990000">Dear {{username}} ,</p>

<p class="normal-text">It's my pleasure to send the first message to arrive
in your mailbox after its conversion to 
<b style="color:#990000"> AUCmail powered by Google. </b>
As we announced earlier, this new suite brings many new features and
greater capacity than our former system--features that can greatly
enhance the way you use e-mail and the related utilities it comes
with.<BR><BR>
I have been using this software for several months in a
pilot project, and it continues to surprise me with options and power
that I didn't know about until I needed them.&nbsp; I hope you will
take some time to explore and experiment with the new system so you
can benefit from all it offers.&nbsp; Also, don't forget 
<A HREF="http://mail-upgrade.aucegypt.edu/help/faqs.html" TARGET="_blank"><U>the
FAQs</U></A> we have prepared.&nbsp; We believe that the web interface at <A HREF="http://mail.aucegypt.edu/" TARGET="_blank"><U>mail.aucegypt.edu</U></A>
has most of the options that many of you previously used programs
like Eudora or Outlook Express for, and we urge you to try it for a
few days. <BR>
<BR>I send you the best wishes of all of us in the
Office of Information Technology for a successful and enjoyable term.</P>
